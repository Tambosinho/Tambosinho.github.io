In this final assignment for the Exploratory Analysis and Data Visualization course, I used a Kaggle dataset about investments in startups over the world to understand how different categories of startup evolved during the past 15 years.

I wanted to highlight most important information, presenting in a concise, readable, and elegant way. In the picture we can identify some impacful moments in history, like the 2004's boom, and get info from the annotations. Beyond that, the picture is modern and pleasant.

<br>Technologies:</br> Python, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and Photoshop.
