title: "Applying PageRank to recommend users of social media platforms"
description: "Final paper project for Linear Algebra course. We applied PageRank algorithm to predict, based on interactions in the social network (likes, comments, follow, etc), recommendation of must-know people for a particular user. Dataset taken from Kaggle."

This project was my first actual experience writing LaTex-academic-papers —except for smaller high-school experiences, like [this physics “tiny-research”](https://youtu.be/z1UvTNPSaYM) and [this economics proposal](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TW8jOCdj4_ZhS3ytqgCf1odT8Xe-Bl58?usp=sharing) (both developed during olympiads) — and I found it quite interesting!

I really didn’t appreciate the Linear Algebra course, but this particular assignment made me realize how impactful simple algorithms can be for businesses and how many ideas I can possibly conceive by just learning a couple fundamental algorithms.
